# RPGMaker2003
Progress within RPG Maker 2003 and the games made with it.

The demo file within the T4 folder contains a readme-file that's "supposed" to say that the containing Izh-file is just to be unzipped and there you go, the playable file. Any feedback would be swell.

To be noted:
The only difference between folder files and archive RAR files is my commits from two seperate computers and doesn't affect anything in-game in present/future updates what so ever.
