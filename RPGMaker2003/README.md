# RPGMaker2003
Progress within RPG Maker 2003 and the games made with it.

The demo file within the T4 folder contains a readme-file that's "supposed" to say that the containing Izh-file is just to be unzipped and there you go, the playable file. Any feedback would be swell.

To be noted:
The only difference between folder files and archive RAR files is my commits from two seperate computers and doesn't affect anything in-game in present/future updates what so ever.

## "The Land of Sh√•-of"
The most prominent of RPGM2K3 projects is TLoS. It enters a shamanistic protagonist in a non-linear land of choices that feature:
- Impactful choices that decide the ultimate fate of the world 
- Morality options, the choosing between right and wrong
- Stats that reflect your behaviour during events
- Secrets in the shrubbery and overworld side tasks that lead to helpful additional resources if you have the perception for it
- Timed campaign with handmade day/night cycling that adds to the overall aesthetic and time-specific events, one can check the time at any, well, time

Incredibly unfinished in it's current state.
